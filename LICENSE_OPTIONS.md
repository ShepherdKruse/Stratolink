# License Options for Stratolink

## Current: MIT License

**Pros:**
- Requires attribution (copyright notice must be included)
- Simple and widely accepted
- Encourages maximum adoption
- Low legal friction for partners

**Cons:**
- Attribution may be buried in "third-party licenses" section
- No requirement for prominent credit
- Partners can use commercially without additional agreements

## Alternative 1: Apache 2.0 License

**Pros:**
- Stronger attribution requirements (must include NOTICE file if provided)
- Explicit patent grant (protects you and users)
- Still permissive for commercial use
- Better for partnerships (explicit patent protection)

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex than MIT
- Still allows commercial use without partnership agreements

## Alternative 2: BSD 3-Clause License

**Pros:**
- Similar to MIT but with explicit "no endorsement" clause
- Prevents partners from using your name to endorse their products
- Still requires attribution

**Cons:**
- Similar to MIT in terms of commercial use permissions

## Alternative 3: Dual Licensing Strategy

**Approach:**
- Open source: MIT or Apache 2.0 for community
- Commercial: Custom license for partners requiring:
  - Prominent attribution in UI/documentation
  - Partnership agreement terms
  - Optional: revenue sharing or contribution requirements

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- Community gets open access
- Partners get clear terms and you get stronger credit

**Cons:**
- More complex to manage
- Requires legal review for commercial license

## Recommendation for Nonprofit Partnerships

For a nonprofit wanting to ensure credit while maintaining partnership appeal:

1. **Keep MIT for community/open source use** - maximizes adoption
2. **Create a "Partnership License"** for commercial partners that requires:
   - Prominent attribution (logo/name in UI or documentation)
   - Partnership agreement terms
   - Optional: contribution back to project

This allows you to:
- Stay open for community benefit
- Negotiate better terms with commercial partners
- Ensure proper credit in partnership contexts
