# Adding the Stratolink Logo

## Where to Place the Logo File

1. **For Repository/README Display:**
   - Place your logo file as: `assets/images/logo.png`
   - Supported formats: PNG (recommended), SVG, or JPG
   - Recommended size: 400x400px or larger for high quality
   - Transparent background preferred

2. **For Web Application:**
   - Place the same logo file as: `web/public/images/logo.png`
   - This will be used in the Next.js application
   - The web app will automatically use this file

## File Naming

Use one of these names:
- `logo.png` (recommended)
- `logo.svg` (for scalable vector)
- `stratolink-logo.png`

## After Adding the Logo

Once you add the logo file:
1. The README.md will automatically display it at the top
2. The web application home page will show it
3. You can reference it elsewhere using the paths above

## Current Status

The logo structure is set up, but the actual logo image file needs to be added to:
- `assets/images/logo.png`
- `web/public/images/logo.png` (copy of the same file)
